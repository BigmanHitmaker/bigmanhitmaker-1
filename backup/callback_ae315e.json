Step up, I'll make it sting\nUndisputed, undefeated—I'm the knockout king\n\n[Verse 2]\nRopes bounce back, mirror my resilience\nOpponent's stance shaky, lacking that brilliance\nFeint left, jab right, now he feeling delirious\nChamp belt gleaming, proof my grind's serious\n\nThey doubted the kid, said I'd fall like dominoes\nNow I'm stacking W's, building my throne of gold\nSweatbands soaked, but the fire's still burning\nRound after round, my hunger keeps churning\n\n[Bridge]\nLeather gloves singing songs of destruction\nEach punch poetry, lyrical concussion\nCrowd on their feet, chanting my name loud\nFrom dirt to dynasty, I made my fam proud"
